# SanctuAIry-baseline-manifests

This repository serves as the Reference Value Provider for the SanctuAIry serviceâ€™s Intel TDX attestation flow. It houses the versioned, cryptographically anchored baseline manifest that describes the knownâ€‘good measurements of the Intel TDX Confidential VM (Trust Domain) used by SanctuAIry.

The manifest file is pinned to a Git tag (e.g., v1.0.0) and contains only the immutable values that a Verifier must compare against live attestation evidence.

## ðŸ”‘ What is a Baseline Manifest?

A baseline manifest captures the static, buildâ€‘time measurements of the Confidential VM and its underlying TDX platform. When SanctuAIryâ€™s Verifier receives a TDX Quote from a running VM, it fetches the corresponding manifest and performs exact-match or threshold checks on these fields:

| Field           | Description                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`       | Git tag for this manifest release (e.g. `v1.0.0`).                                                   |
| `createdAt`     | ISO-8601 timestamp when this manifest was generated.                                                 |
| `author`        | Email or identity of the CI system that generated the manifest.                                      |
| `sourceImage`   | GCP Compute Image URL used to launch the reference VM.                                               |
| `sourceImageId` | GCP-assigned numeric Image ID for the golden VM disk.                                                |
| `mrTd`          | **SHA-384** measurement of the VMâ€™s initial memory state. Exact match required.                      |
| `mrSeam`        | **SHA-384** measurement of the Intel TDX Moduleâ€™s code. Exact match required.                        |
| `tdAttributes`  | Flags describing the TDâ€™s launch attributes (e.g. DEBUG bit). Exact match required.                  |
| `xfam`          | Extended-features-allowed mask (CPU features). Exact match required.                                 |
| `teeTcbSvn`     | Minimum Trusted Computing Base Security-Version Number. Verifier checks live value â‰¥ this threshold. |

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repo and check out the desired tag:

    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/YourOrg/SanctuAIry-baseline-manifests.git>
    cd SanctuAIry-baseline-manifests
    git checkout v1.0.0
    ```

2. Inspect the manifest in baseline-manifest.jsonc. Confirm its fields match the expected golden measurements.

3. Configure your Verifier to fetch the manifest at runtime. The Verifier parses and uses these values to validate incoming TDX Quotes.

    ```
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourOrg/SanctuAIry-baseline-manifests/v1.0.0/baseline-manifest.jsonc>
    ```

## ðŸ”„ Versioning and Releases

-   New baseline manifests are released by creating a signed Git tag. The tag name (v1.1.0, v2.0.0, etc.) reflects the VM image version or security update.

-   Signed tags (git tag -s vX.Y.Z) ensure authenticity: the tag itself is GPGâ€‘signed by the CI systemâ€™s key.

-   Verifiers pin to a specific tag or commit hash, guaranteeing immutability of the reference values.
